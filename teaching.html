        <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            My teaching approach integrates theoretical understanding with hands-on application.
            I emphasize safety, process awareness, and engineering judgment while mentoring
            students to connect design, manufacturing, and material performance.
            By combining laboratory instruction with real-world industrial examples,
            I aim to prepare students for both research and manufacturing environments.
